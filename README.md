<p>Welcome to my simple website! This page demonstrates the use of a header, paragraph, background, box model, and flexbox.</p>
 
    
<div class="container">
<div class="box">With much thanks to the internet and social media, it’s become easier to interact with family and friends online! Ever since the first telephone to the first computer, engineers have made it a haven for friendly interaction around the world. Though this has some bad effects as well, you can’t just talk to the friends you’ve made in real life but also make friends with those online, people that you don’t know behind the screen. There has been several cases of kidnappings, doxxing, and threats made to others online just from a simple type of technology like a phone. Those kinds of actions that you, yourself shouldn’t take. Be aware, be sure of who’s there.</div>
<div class="box">From the start of the first computer by Charles Babbage, to the latest Apple macbook, technology is reaching new heights every day. Engineers are on the grind for more advancements and to make things more simple for the common user. They’ve gotten so advanced, they made AI. Just not like those AI in games where they track you, but an AI that helps people with work. Many people use AI, while it may not be most preferred, it certainly helps when you’re stuck. Like when you don’t know what to write next, you can ask the AI and you can use it as reference to your own. This is what I’m doing right now! AI shouldn’t take your job, but help you as an assistant.</div>
<div class="box">Continuing off the last sentence, with rising technology.. Jobs are getting replaced and not many people are needed now. With this comes with less opportunities, less sources of income for the people. Take action! Not all jobs should be replaced just for the convenience of the big companies. No AI should be used as a replacement of the people, let it be what it was supposed to be. An assistant, no less, no more than that.</div>
